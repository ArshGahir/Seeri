# Seeri

Seeri - A punjabi word for hired hand. My Dad finds it amusing that Apple's Siri and a traditional Seeri perform the same tasks.

An LLM integration for Siri and Google Assistant to accept vocal commands in Punjabi and control connected IoT devices via the SiriHomeKit or Google Assistant app.
